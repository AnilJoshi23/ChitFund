# Why ReactJS?
> React has one of the best communities out there with many 3rd party open source libraries.

> The React library itself is a component based architecture making it easier to create bigger production apps by breaking up the big app into easy to test components.

> React renders and rerenders content very fast by having an extremely efficient virtual dom algorithm to determine the minimal number of changes needed to rerender.
